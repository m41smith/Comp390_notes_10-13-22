use request function to get data from NASA site

bounding boxes = {'region_name': (geolocation bounding box)}
    will be provided for us
bounding box(left long, bottom lat, right long, top lat)

use json to convert data to lists of dictionaries
loop through json data once
check if entry does have a geolocation
    if no, skip to next entry
    if yes, extract geolocation(lat, long)
        check if lat is within bounding box range (if meteorite doesn't fit into any of the 7 boxes, move to next entry)
            if no, check next bounding box
            if yes, check if long fit within bounding box range
                if no, move on to the next box
                if yes, extract (name, mass, lat, long)
                    insert the (name, mass, lat, long) into the appropriate table

connect to database
do error checking (try, except)
create 7 region tables
database will only have 3 columns (Name, Mass, geolocation)
make cursor object
db_connection.commit()
db_connection.close()

justify each function with doc string ("""doc string""")
